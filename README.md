# Street-Smart-Unveiling-Retail-Opportunities-in-Regent-s-Park

In this study, we have employed the analytical power of the OSMnx library to parse through the intricacies of the street network around Regent's Park, identifying critical nodes with significant closeness and betweenness centrality\. This has allowed us to pinpoint potential retail hotspots that synergize high accessibility with existing commercial facilities and public transitâ€”a critical interplay for retail success. However, any proposed development must navigate the unique constraints and heritage considerations of the park's urban landscape, ensuring that commercial viability aligns with the area's character and regulatory framework.
